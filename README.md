## About the game

Simon says is a simple electronic memory game: the user has to repeat a growing sequence of colors.
The sequence is displayed by lighting up the LEDs. Each color also has a corresponding tone.

In each turn, the game will play the sequence, and then wait for the user to repeat the sequence
by pressing the buttons according to the color sequence.
If the user repeated the sequence correctly, the game will play a "leveling-up" sound,
add a new color at the end of the sequence, and move to the next turn.

The game continues until the user has made a mistake. Then a game over sound is played, and the game restarts.

## Online simulation
